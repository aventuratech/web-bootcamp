## Getting Started

there are three languages that we use for every website:

* HTML: this is the language that we use to write pages that are displayed in the browser
* CSS: this is the language that we use to make the HTML pages beautiful
* JavaScript: this is the language that we use to bring our web pages to life

You are going to learn a little of each over the course of this course.

To get started you need to create the basic HTML page:

1. create a new folder called `awesome-photo-gallery`
2. add a new file to the awesome photo gallery called `index.html`
3. Copy and paste the template below into the `index.html` file

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

If you open the page in the browser you will see blank page. Not very exciting, but this is the beginning of every 
website. Now you are ready to get creative!

You will notice that this template has two sections, the `<head>` and the `<body>`:

* the head is where you tell the browser more about your page, things like the title, language, description, etc
* the body is where all of the content that the browser should display.

## The page head

! Setup title and description

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Awesome Photo Gallery</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Some beautiful stock photography"/>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

If you reload your browser now its still a blank page, but you might notice that the browser tab now shows that you are
on your "Awesome Photo Gallery".

## Adding some content

1. add hero section
2. add large image to hero and explain images
3. add h1 and explain how headers work
4. add lead p with lorem ipsum (explain lorem ipsum)
