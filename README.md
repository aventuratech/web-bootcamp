## Courses

Our courses are four week long sessions with two lessons per week. We have live sessions where our teachers guide the students through the lessons, but you can take them on your own schedule.

### Lessons 

Each lesson takes around an hour. The lessons are made up of sections, and most have 4 15 minute sections.

Each section consist of:

#### Video

Each section starts with a 5 minute video where we discuss what we are going to do to the project, then we program the feature live.

#### Practice

After the live programming our application guides you through the task step by step. You have 5 minutes to complete this.

#### Challenge

Finally we have a programming challenge for each section, and have another 5 minutes to complete it.
